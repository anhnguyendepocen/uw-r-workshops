# Summer 2019: Open Coding Lab

UW-Libraries and the Data Science Hub will be hosting Open Coding Lab at Steenbock Library this summer. Use this time to work with your own data and get help from other coders. 

The sessions will be on **Tuesdays from 2:30 pm to 4:30 pm** on the first floor of **Steenbock Library**. See the schedule below for more details. (Schedule is subject to change)

Date | Location | Host
-----|--------- |--------
8/13 | Biocommons Lounge (110C)| Tobin Magle and Sarah Stevens
8/20 | Biocommons Lounge (110C)| Tobin Magle and Sarah Stevens
8/27 | Biocommons Lounge (110C)| Tobin Magle and Sarah Stevens

# Registration for the Spring 2019 workshops is full. 
Feel free to join the waitlist using the registration links below. If you would like to join our listserve to be kept up to date on new workshops for Summer and Fall 2019, email join-rds-r-workshops@lists.wisc.edu.

# R workshops for researchers
UW-Madison libraries are offering R programming Workshops on R programming for researchers. The intended audience is anyone at the univerity who is working with tabular research data (including graduate students, faculty, research staff, and undergraduate researchers) and would like to learn how to automate data processing using the R programming language. The content is based heavily on the R Ecology Data Carpentry content, but will cover useful skills for anyone working with tabular data. Later sessions go beyone the Data Carpentry Lessons to cover how to use git version control within R Studio and writing reproducible reports using RMarkdown.

## Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for the R basics session, though those with some experience working with tabular data will get the most out of the session. All other sessions require the R basics session or some experience using R (ie, how to use the assignment operator and functions). Please email tobin.magle@wisc.edu if you have questions.

## Registration
Registration is by workshop, not for the entire series. Please feel free to register for whatever sessions you feel are appropriate for you. Software for these sessions is pre installed on the computer lab machines at Steenbock Library. Registration is required to ensure that we have enough computers to accomodate the number of attendees. If you are on the waitlist and would like to bring your own device to the session, email tobin.magle@wisc.edu to discuss what software you will need to install before the session.

## Schedule
These workshops will be held biweekly on Fridays in Steenbock Classroom 105 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison unless otherwise noted.

## Content
Below are descriptions of each workshop. Workshop slides and other content can be found [here](https://researchguides.library.wisc.edu/R)

### R basics

Learning how to code can be intimidating, but will save you time and effort in the long run. This workshop will cover the basics of R programming. By the end of this session, you will be able to create variables, use pre-defined functions, understand data types and load and inspect a dataset using RStudio. This workshop is geared toward programming novices, so no previous experience is required. 

### R Data wrangling

What you can do with your data depends strongly on how its formatted. This workshop will cover how to manipulate datasets using an R package called dplyr. After this session, you will be able to subset, reformat and summarize your data. A basic working knowledge of R and R studio would be helpful for you to get the most out of this session.

### R data visualization

So you're familiar with R, but want to do more with your plots than the base graphics package. This workshop will show you how to use the ggplot2 package in R. After this session, you will be able to create a variety of plot types, alter their aesthetics, and create custom themes.
Prerequisites	A working knowledge of R and R studio and dplyr would be helpful for you to get the most out of this session.

### R version control

We've all intuitively used some type of version control in our work such as saving multiple versions of a document. While easy, it can cause file bloat and ultimately become more complicated. Luckily, formal version control systems have been developed to streamline this process.This workshop will cover version control using git. After this session, you'll be able to create a git repository, make and add changes to the repository, and use GitHub to remotely store your repository.

### R reports

Documenting your analysis in a way that is understandable to a colleague (or yourself 3 months later) can be challenging. One way to make reports more readable, even by people who don't code, is to alternate human readable text with machine readable code. This month's Coding and Cookies will cover creating reproducible reports of this type using knitr. After this session, you will be able to create R markdown documents, add formatted text and executable code blocks, and render the R markdown document into a final report.
