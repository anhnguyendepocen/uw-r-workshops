Workshops taught through Steenbock library on R programming for researchers. Based heavily on the Data Carpentry content.

## Tentative Schedule
These workshops will be held biweekly on Fridays from 10 am to 12 pm in Steenbock Classroom 105 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

### R basics

Learning how to code can be intimidating, but will save you time and effort in the long run. This workshop will cover the basics of R programming. By the end of this session, you will be able to create variables, use pre-defined functions, understand data types and load and inspect a dataset using RStudio. This workshop is geared toward programming novices, so no previous experience is required. 

### R Data wrangling

What you can do with your data depends strongly on how its formatted. This workshop will cover how to manipulate datasets using an R package called dplyr. After this session, you will be able to subset, reformat and summarize your data. A basic working knowledge of R and R studio would be helpful for you to get the most out of this session.

### R data visualization

So you're familiar with R, but want to do more with your plots than the base graphics package. This month's Coding and Cookies will show you how to use the ggplot2 package in R. After this session, you will be able to create a variety of plot types, alter their aesthetics, and create custom themes.
Prerequisites	A working knowledge of R and R studio and dplyr would be helpful for you to get the most out of this session.

### R version control

We've all intuitively used some type of version control in our work such as saving multiple versions of a document. While easy, it can cause file bloat and ultimately become more complicated. Luckily, formal version control systems have been developed to streamline this process.This workshop will cover version control using git. After this session, you'll be able to create a git repository, make and add changes to the repository, and use GitHub to remotely store your repository.

### R reports

Documenting your analysis in a way that is understandable to a colleague (or yourself 3 months later) can be challenging. One way to make reports more readable, even by people who don't code, is to alternate human readable text with machine readable code. This month's Coding and Cookies will cover creating reproducible reports of this type using knitr. After this session, you will be able to create R markdown documents, add formatted text and executable code blocks, and render the R markdown document into a final report.
